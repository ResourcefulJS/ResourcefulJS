ResourcefulJS
=============

This project i still in very much pre-alpha.

The idea is to create at simple lightweight framework, to get a RESTful server up an running with as little effort as possible. 
(I'm a frontend developer, I just want my resources stored somewhere, I don't care how. I just want to create my frontend application.)

First would create a server that exposes a resource using Express, and stores them in a file using NeDB.
